<font face="Franklin Gothic Book, sans-serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span lang="en">This
agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of New Brunswick,
Canada, and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without
regard to conflict of laws provisions, and you agree to submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the Province of New
Brunswick, Canada. The parties expressly agree that the United
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
shall not apply to these Terms of Service. No joint venture,
partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you
and GoCapture as a result of this agreement or your use of the
Services. You may not assign these Terms of Service or assign or
delegate any rights or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part,
without the prior written consent of GoCapture. If any part of this
agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to
applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty
disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the
invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a
valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of
the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall
continue in effect. A waiver by GoCapture of any provision of these
Terms of Service, or any breach thereof, in any one instance, shall
not waive such provision or any subsequent breach thereof. Unless
otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire
agreement between you and GoCapture with respect to the Services and
the Application and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written,
between you and GoCapture with respect to the Services and the
Application. You agree to execute and deliver any such documentation
and/or consents, perform further acts and provide all assistance and
information reasonably requested by GoCapture to give effect to these
Terms of Service. Any notice or other communication to be given
hereunder will be in writing and given (a) by GoCapture, via email
(in each case to the address that you provide) or by posting such
notice within the Application or in a change log, and (b) by you, to
the address listed above or to such other addresses as GoCapture may
specify in writing. The date of receipt will be deemed the date on
which such notice is transmitted. A printed version of this agreement
and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in
judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this
agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as
other business documents and records originally generated and
maintained in printed form. Where the Terms of Service have been
provided in a language other than English, you agree that the
translation is provided for your convenience and that the English
version of these Terms of Service shall govern to the extent of any
conflict which may exist.</span></font></font></p>
